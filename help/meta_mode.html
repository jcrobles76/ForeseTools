<CENTER><H2>Metadata Analysis</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Overview</H3>
The Metadata Analysis mode allows the investigator to view the
details of metadata structures.  The metadata structures on the
on-disk structures that contain the details of a file, such as
times and pointers to the allocated data units.  FFS and EXT2FS
file systems call them inode structures, NTFS file systems call
them Master File Table (MFT) entries (or File Entries), and the
FAT file system calls them directory entries.  This mode is useful
for recovering data and getting a detailed look at a file. 

<H3>Input</H3>
To view the contents of a structure, enter the address in the text
box on the left and select <U>Display</U>.

<P>
The <U>Allocation List</U> button can also be used to view the
allocation status of metadata structures in groups of 500.

<H3>Viewing</H3>
The structure details are displayed on the right-hand side.
Typically, the metadata structure does not have the name of the
file that uses that structure, so Autopsy will try to locate the
file name.  This process is slow with a FAT file system, so it is
not done by default.

<P>
The <U>File Type</U> is given, which is the output of the 'file'
tool.  This tool uses any header information in the file to
guess what its type is.  The MD5 value of the file is also given.

<P>
If Autopsy has been configured to use hash databases, then one can
select which databases to look for the file in.  See 
<A HREF="hash_db.html">Hash Databases</A> for more details.  

<P>
The rest of the information will vary depending on the file
system type.  In general, the allocation status will be given as
well as the size and each data unit that it has allocated.  A
link will exist for each data unit that will show its contents.  

<P>
The <U>Report</U> option generates an ASCII report with the structure
details, MD5 values, and dates in it.  The <U>View Contents</U> option
displays the allocated data contents as one large file.  The <U>Export</U>
option allows one to save the data contents to a file.  The
<U>Add Note</U> button allows one to add a comment about this structure so
that it can be later recalled. 

<H3>NTFS Notes</H3>
<P>
NTFS is a much different design than UNIX file systems and the meta
data structures are addressed differently.  They typically have
the form of <TT>A-B-C</TT>, <TT>88-128-3</TT> for example.  The
<TT>A</TT> value is the address of the file in the Master File
Table, 88 for example. This is similar to the inode value in UNIX.
Each file has several attributes, including at least one in files
for the data.  The <TT>B</TT> value is the type of attribute.  In
most cases, the data attribute has a type of 128 so this is commonly
seen.  But, if you want to see the file name attribute, you could
specify that type and see the contents if you like (it is fairly
boring).  The final value, <TT>C</TT>, is the id.  Every attribute
has a unique id value.  So, if there are multiple attributes with
the same type, you can specify the type.

<H3>FAT Notes</H3>
<P>
FAT does not give addresses to the directory entry structures.  in
FAT, directory entries can be stored anywhere on the disk.  They
are stored in the clusters allocated to the parent directory.  This
is unlike NTFS or UNIX where the structures are in a large table
that does not move.  get around that,


<P>
The addressing issue was solved by providing an address to every
32-byte area in the Data Area.  Whether that data was currently a
directory entry or not.  This makes it easy to find a given address
and scale when new files are created.  The downside is that not
every address is possible, so it is likely that you will see jumps
in the address values.  See the documentation in The Sleuth Kit
for more details.
