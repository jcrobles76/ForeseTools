<CENTER><H2>Keyword Search</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
This mode searches an image for a given string.  This is most useful
when searching for deleted content.  To decrease the time required
for a search, a "strings" file can serve as an index.  This file
will contain only the ASCII strings in the image.  

<P>
Autopsy will also prompt you to create a file of unallocated data if one
does not exist.  This obviously is useful for recovering deleted data. 
If a string is found in this file, Autopsy will also report the location
in the original image.  

<H3>Entering the String</H3>

Enter the string or regular expression into the text box.  Autopsy
allows you to search for a either a specific string or using 'grep'
style regular expressions.  A case insensitive search will occur
if the appropriate box is checked, otherwise it is case sensitive.
You will also have the option of searching for the string as an
ASCII or a Unicode string.  Unicode is much more common in Windows
systems than Unix systems.  If both types are selected, then two
searches will be done.

<P>
If you have not generated a strings file or unallocated data file yet,
that option will exist.

<P>
The <U>Load Unallocated Image</U> or <U>Load Allocated Image</U> button
exists to switch between the two file types if they have both been
generated.  

<P>
Autopsy also has the ability to perform pre-configured searches.  They
are shown in the "Predefined Searches" section.  

<H3>Viewing the Results</H3>
After the image has been searched, a list of "hits" will appear on the
left-hand side.  Each data unit that contains the string is listed with
the offset of each occurrence.  If a regular expression is used, then the
exact location is not given.  

<P>
If the search was done on an unallocated data file, then an option will
exist next to each address to also view the original.  Doing so could
reveal the inode that allocated it.

<H3>Previous Searches</H3>
The search results are saved to a file so it is easy to recall the
results with out having to perform the search again.  

<H3>Regular Expressions</H3>
You can use grep regular expressions in the search
(refer to the 'grep' <A HREF="grep.html">
help page</A> and man page for more details).   To search for
a couple of different words you would use: <TT>(foo) | (bar)</TT>.
