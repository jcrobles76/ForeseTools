<H3>Overview</H3>
It is always important to validate the integrity of images during
an analysis.  Autopsy uses the MD5 algorithm to validate images
and other files that are created by Autopsy.  

<P>
The <TT>md5.txt</TT> files contain the MD5 values for files in that
directory.  Values are added to it when file system images are 
imported into the system or when Autopsy creates the file.  This mode
allows one to calculate the MD5 value if it was not created before 
and to validate the integrity.

<P>
When the <U>Image Integrity</U> button is selected from the <U>Host
Manager</U> window, all files will be shown with their MD5 value
if known.  Here any image can have its value verified or a new one
created.
