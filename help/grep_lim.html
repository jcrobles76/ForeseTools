<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
Keyword searches are very basic in Autopsy.  Autopsy uses the
<TT>strings</TT> and <TT>grep</TT> tools on the image and when a
hit is found, it uses <TT>ifind</TT> and <TT>ffind</TT> to identify
the file that has allocated the string.  This is a very simple and
basic method of searching and is not ideal.  This will cause false
positives and will miss data that crosses a fragmented part of a file.
The limitations are outlined in this file.

<H3>What Will Be Found</H3>
<TT>strings</TT> is first run on the image and the data is passed
to <TT>grep</TT> to do the actual search.  This process will find
ASCII and UNICODE strings that are consecutive anywhere in the file.   This is
frequently referred to as the physical layout.  For example, it
will find strings in the middle of an allocated sector, in an
unallocated sector, in slack space, and in meta data strutures.
This will find a string that crosses sectors, which is good if the
two sectors are for the same file.

<P>
This technique leads to several types of false positives.  For example,
a string that crosses from the allocated space of a file into the slack
space would be found by <TT>grep</TT>.  A string that starts in the slack space
and ends in the allocated space of a file will also be found.  A string 
that crosses sectors of two different allocated files will also be found.  The
user must identify if the hit is an actual hit or a false positive.  

<h3>What Will Be Found, but May Be Confusing</h3>
<p>
If you are searching with regular expressions, then the exact
location and number of hits may not be correctly reported.  If the
count is incorrect, then it will be too small.  If the location
is incorrect, then it will be too early (and could even be in the
next data unit).  The reason that this is in accurate is because
the <tt>grep</tt> tool will return a long string to Autopsy that
will contain one or more occurances of the keyword.  Autopsy can
not search the long string to find the exact number and location
of the regular expression keywords like it can for non-regular
expression keywords, so it returns only the starting location of
the long string.

<H3>What Will NOT Be Found</H3>
The biggest category of 'hits' that will not occur using this technique
is strings in a file that cross fragmented data units.  For example, consider
a file that has two clusters allocated, cluster 100 and cluster 150.  A 
string "mississippi" could have "missi" in the final 5 bytes of cluster 100
and "ssippi" in the initial 6 bytes of cluster 150.  The string exists from
the logial level, but not at the physical level.  Therefore, the <TT>grep</TT>
search would not find the string.  

<P>
Although not because of <TT>grep</TT>, Autopsy will also not find
data in the slack space during an unallocated-only search.  The
extraction tool for The Sleuth Kit (<TT>blkls</TT>) differentiates
between unallocated sectors in FAT and NTFS and slack space.  There
is currently no way in Autopsy to extract the slack space and search
it.  Autopsy currently only extracts the unallocated sectors and not
the allocated sectors that may have deleted data in them.


<H3>Conclusion</H3>
Autopsy has basic keyword search functionality.  Future versions may provide
more features and better search results.  In the mean time, it is important
that users understand the abilities and limitations of the tool so that they
can be taken into account during the investigation.
