<P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
Sometimes there are details about an image that do not correspond to
any file in particular.  Those details can likely be found in this
mode.  This mode gives the general details of the image and therefore
the contents will vary depending on the file system type.  

<P>
<H3>FFS & EXT2FS</H3>
For the UNIX file systems, this mode will contain the details from
the super block.  This generally includes times that the file system
was last mounted and any special flags.  It also has the range of
inode addresses and fragment addresses.   For advanced file recovery,
you can also identify the group layout and on-disk structure details.
These could be useful for restricting where you search for data.
Files will allocate blocks and fragments in the same Cylinder or
Block group as their inode is in, so your attention can be restricted
to that area.


<P>
<H3>FAT</H3>
For FAT file systems, this mode will contain the File Allocation
Table.  It will have the cluster runs, which can be selected to
view their contents in <A HREF="data_mode.html">data unit</A>
analysis mode.  Or, if the file is fragmented, the pointer can
be selected and the screen will link to the next cluster chain.  


<P>
<H3>NTFS</H3>
The unique information for an NTFS image is the numerical type
associated with attributes.  These values can be dynamic and this
area will identify what they are for that file system.
