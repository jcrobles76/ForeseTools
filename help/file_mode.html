<CENTER><H2>File Analysis</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Overview</H3>
The File Analysis mode allows one to analyze an image from the file
and directory perspective.  This provides the same interface that users
typically use with a normal computer.  This mode will also display 
information about deleted files though.  

<P>
This mode will allow one to examine the contents of files and directories
for evidence.  It even allows one to perform basic binary analysis by
extracting the ASCII strings from a binary file.  The files can also
be sorted by any field.  


<H3>Directory List</H3>
<P>
The left-hand side window has four main options:
<UL>
  <li>Directory Seek
  <li>File Name Search
  <LI>Hide / Expand Directories
  <LI>Show All Deleted Files
</UL>

<P>
By default, the directory listing is not shown when this mode is
first entered.  By select the <U>Expand Directories</U> button,
the full list of directories will be shown.  The number of '+'
symbols represent the depth of the directory.   As this is an HTML
interface and there is no state management occurring (no cookies
or session id), it would be difficult to have an interface where
one or more directories are expanded yet the rest are collapsed.

<P>
Selecting the <U>All Deleted Files</U> link will display all of the deleted
files in the image on the right-hand side.

<P>
There is a text box where a directory (or file) name can be
entered and it will be displayed on the right-hand side.  This
makes it easy to jump to a directory without going through the
directory listings.  For example, to seek to the 'windows\system32'
folder, you can enter that string into the box instead of scrolling
through the directories.

<p>
There is also a text box where a pattern of a file name can be
entered and all files that match that pattern will be displayed on
the right-hand side.  The search pattern is a Perl regular expression,
so some values, such as '.' or '*' will need to be escaped.  The
search is done case insensitive.  To find all files that have a JPG
extension, the following could be used "\.jpg".  Or to find all files
that begin with a dot, then we could use "^\.".  


<H3>Directory Contents</H3>
<P>
The window in the upper right-hand side contains the directory
contents.  In a file system, a directory allocates data units on
the disk and fills the data units with structures that contain the
name of the file and the address of the meta data structure.  This
view parses the file name structures in the directory.  It is filled
by either selecting a directory from the left-hand side directory
list or a directory from within the same window.  The entries can
be resorted by clicking on any of the header values.

<P>
The column headers have the following definitions:
<UL>
  <LI><B>del</B>: A check in this column represents a deleted file.
  See below for a discussion on the different color types of deleted files.

  <LI><B>Type</B>: This column contains the "type" that the file or
  directory is. There are two values.  The first (<TT>dir</TT>) is the
  type according to the directory entry structure.  The directory entry
  is where the file name is located.  The second value (<TT>in</TT>) is
  the type according to the meta data structure.
  These should be the same except
  for deleted files.  They are both given to help the investigator
  identify if a deleted file has been reallocated or not.  For example,
  if the meta data structure type is different than the file name
  type, then it is likely that one of the structures was reallocated for
  a new file.  

  <LI><B>Name</B>: The name of the file or directory.  Clicking on the
  name displays file contents in the bottom window or directory contents
  in the same window.  For deleted files, no link will exist if the meta
  data structure address 
  has been cleared (which many OS do).  To identify the destination of 
  a UNIX symbolic link,
  click on the address at the end of the row.  Note that the name
  will not be a link if the size of the file is 0 or if the meta data
  structure is unknown.  

  <LI><B>Modified Time</B>: This column exists for UNIX and NTFS file 
  systems.  It shows the last time that the file data was last modified.
  In other words, when was data last written to the data units allocated
  by the file.  In UNIX, the <TT>utimes()</TT> function can modify this
  value vary easily.  

  <LI><B>Written Time</B>: This column exists for FAT file systems and
  is the time when the file was last written to.  Of the three times,
  this is the only value that is required by the FAT specification.  

  <LI><B>Accessed Time</B>: This column contains the last accessed time of
  the file data.  On a FAT image, this value is optional and is only
  accurate to the day (not hours or seconds).  This value can be 
  modified by the utimes() function in UNIX.

  <LI><B>Changed Time</B>: This column exists for UNIX and NTFS file
  systems.  It is the last time that the file status (or meta data) was
  changed.  This is different than the Modified time because modified
  deals with the file data and this deals with the descriptive data
  in the inode or MFT entry.    This value cannot be changed by the
  <TT>utimes()</TT> function in UNIX.  

  <LI><B>Created Time</B>: This column exists for NTFS and FAT file systems.  It
  is the time when the file was created.  According to the FAT spec,
  it is an optional time.  

  <LI><B>Size</B>: The size of the file.  Note that if the size of the
  file is 0, no link will be shown with the name.  

  <LI><B>UID</B>: The User ID of the file owner.

  <LI><B>GID</B>: The Group ID of the file owner.

  <LI><B>Meta Data</B>: The file name structures contain a pointer to
  the meta data structure that describes the file.  This column contains
  the address of the structure.  Selecting this value
  will display the details in the bottom window.
  If the value is invalid, then a link will not exist.  If it is for
  a deleted file name that has a meta data structure with an allocated
  status, a "realloc" string will 
  exist to identify this.  

</UL>
The <U>Add Note</U> link allows you to make a comment about this directory and 
have it saved in your personal notes file.  

<P>
The <U>Generate MD5 List</U>
link will generate the MD5 value for every file in the directory and
allow you to save it as a text file.  Using fingerprint data bases,
This makes it easy to check for files that were modified by an attacker.

<P>
The path on top of the window has hyperlinks in it that allow the
user to easily change to a previous directory.  

<P>
There are two different colors used for deleted files.  The difference
is based on the status of the data structures in the file.  A <FONT
COLOR="red">bright red</FONT> entry means that the file
name data structure is not allocated and the meta data structure
that it points to is also not allocated.  This is what we would
expect of a recently deleted file.  This means that we can trust
the data we are seeing as long as the meta data structure was not
allocated and unallocated since the deletion.  If it is <FONT
COLOR="#800000">darker red</FONT>, then the meta data
structure has been reallocated and the data is most likely not
accurate.


<P>
The file size reported by the meta data structure is very important
with The Sleuth Kit.  The Sleuth Kit uses this value to identify
how many data units to display.  If this size is 0, but the meta
data structure points to data blocks still, they will not be shown.
You can force Autopsy to display the values by selecting the meta
data address and using the 'force' option.

<P>
To look a file up in one of the <A HREF="./hash_db.html">Hash
Databases</A>, then select the meta data address.  That view will
provide an interface to the databases.

<H3>File Contents</H3>
<P>
The lower right-hand side window displays the contents of a specified
file.  The contents can be viewed in either the raw format (which your
browser will not likely display much of if the file is non-ASCII) or
through 'strings'.  The strings option is helpful for a quick analysis
of a binary file.

<P>
Also shown is the file type.  This is determined by running the 'file' 
command on the output.  It uses the magic header and footer values to
guess the file type.  If the file type is an image or HTML, an option
will exist to <U>View</U> the data in its interpreted form (i.e. as
a picture or as a web page instead of the raw data).  Note that
any HTML that is viewed will be processed in a sanitized environment 
that does not load pictures and will not allow one to connect to a 
remote site.  To view the native picture, select 'Export' and open
the HTML document in another browser.  Refer to issue #1 of The Sleuth
Kit Informer for more details on the sanitizing.  

<P>
The <U>Report</U> options create ASCII reports that contain the file 
contents as well as data such as MD5 values and dates.  

<P>
The <U>Export</U> button extracts the file out of the image so you can save it
locally and use other tools on it. 

<P>
The <U>Add Note</U> button adds a personal note to the investigator log for
future reference.
