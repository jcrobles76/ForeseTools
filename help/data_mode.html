<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
The Data Analysis Mode allows an investigator to view the contents
of an individual data unit.  Data units is a generic term used to
describe the areas on the disk that are used to store data.  Each
file system calls the data unit a different thing (i.e.  Fragments
or Clusters).  This mode is most useful when recovering and analyzing
deleted data.

<H3>Input</H3>
<P>
To view the contents of a specific address, enter it into the text
box on the left-hand side.  By default, only one data unit will be
displayed.  To view more than one consecutive unit, enter the
number in the text box below. 

<P>
It is common to extract the unallocated space from a file system
image and analyze it for deleted material.  The 'blkls' tool in The
Sleuth Kit allows one to extract the data.  If interesting data is
found in the 'blkls' file, the next step could be to find its location
in the original image and examine the surrounding data.  To do
this, simply calculate which data unit the data was found in (by
dividing the byte offset of the interesting data by the data unit
size (which can be found in <U>Image Details</U>)).  Enter that
address into the original text box and select the <U>Unallocated</U>
type.  This will find the original location and display it for you.

<P>
If Autopsy knows about the 'blkls' image, then it can be loaded at any
time by selecting the <U>Load Unallocated</U> button.  Then, any
data unit in that file can be examined.  


<P>
The <B>Lazarus</B> tool was part of <TT>TCT</TT>.  It analyzes a chunk
of data and identifies what file type it is and tries to group 
consecutive types together.  Lazarus numbers its output though starting
with 1.  Therefore, instead of subtracting 1 every time you want to view
a data unit identified by Lazarus, simply select the check box.  

<P>
Press the <U>Ok</U> button to display the contents of the address on
the right-hand side of the window.  

<P>
The <U>Allocation List</U> link displays the allocation status of  
addresses in intervals of 500.  


<H3>Viewing</H3>
<P>
After the unit address has been entered, the contents are displayed
in the right-hand side.  Filters can be used to view the data in the
desired format (strings, hexdump, ASCII).

<P>
A report can be generated so that the contents and meta-data about
it will be saved on record.  To save the contents locally, press the
<U>Export Contents</U> button.  The <U>Add Note</U> button will allow
one to add a comment about the given data unit so that it can be
easily recalled later.  

<P>
The file type is also displayed.  This is identified by running
the output through the 'file' command in The Sleuth Kit.



<P>
Autopsy will try to find the meta-data structure that allocated
the unit and display both its address and a file name.  This process
is very slow for FAT file systems, so this process is not done by
default during analysis.

<H3>FAT Notes</H3>
<P>
The Sleuth Kit and Autopsy do not use clusters when dealing with a FAT image.
Only sectors are used.  The reason is because FAT does not start
addressing clusters until many sectors into the file system.  If
clusters were used to address data units, then there would be no
way to address the sectors in the FAT and secondary FAT.  Therefore,
sectors are used for all addresses.  NTFS changed the way clusters
were addressed and do not have this problem.  See the documentation
in The Sleuth Kit for more details.
