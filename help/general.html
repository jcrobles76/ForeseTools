<P>
The Autopsy Forensic Browser is a graphical interface to command
line forensics tools and standard UNIX utilities.   It allows
you to perform volume and file system analysis on UNIX and Windows systems.

<P>
All data are saved in a directory in the Evidence Locker, which
was specified at install time or at run time.  See 
<A HREF="caseman.html">Case Management</A> 
for more information.  In the normal mode, Autopsy imports an
image file from a disk or partition.  In the live mode, Autopsy
can analyze a running system and does not save any data to the 
local disk. 


<P>
The browser has the following modes: 
<UL>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="file_mode.html">Files</A></B>:
Allows you to browse the image file as a file system and view the
contents of files and directories.   This mode even shows deleted
file names and Alternate Data Streams in NTFS images.  You can sort
the files and directories on meta data.

<LI><B><A HREF="meta_mode.html">
Meta Data</A></B>:
Allows you to analyze the image file by examining the meta data structures.
The address of a structure is entered and the details are shown.
This mode is useful for examining unallocated structures and getting
all details about allocated files (including all data units and
other information such as MD5 value).


<LI><B><A HREF="data_mode.html">
Data Unit</A></B>:
Allows browsing by block number.  This is most useful when used
with searching or meta data browsing.  The contents of the block
can be displayed in ASCII, hex dump, or through <I>strings(1)</I>.
The meta data structure that has allocated the block will be
displayed (if any) along with the file name (if any).


<LI><B><A HREF="srch_mode.html">
Keyword Search </A></B>:
Search an image file using <I>grep(1)</I> for a given string or regular
expression.  The result will be a list of data units that have the
string.  Each data unit can be selected to view the contents.


<LI><B><A HREF="fs_mode.html">
Image Details</A></B>:
List the details about the file or volume system.  The output of
this mode depends on the file system.  Examples of the file system
data include the last mount time, the last mount location, and a
detailed break down of block group information or File Allocation
Table contents.

<LI><B><A HREF="int_mode.html">
Image Integrity</A></B>:
The integrity of the data can be validated at any
point by selecting this mode.  It uses the values in <TT>md5.txt</TT> to
identify if any data have been modified in the analysis process.

<LI><B><A HREF="tl.html">
File Activity Timelines</A></B>:
Autopsy can create timelines of file activity based on the Modified,
Access, and Change (Create in FAT/NTFS) times (MAC).  The timeline
will contain details about deleted and allocated content.  The
resulting timeline can be either viewed within Autopsy or using
other text viewing tools (WARNING: many HTML browsers do not handle
large tables like a timeline very well so using a text editor is 
recommended).

<LI><B><A HREF="file_category.html">
File Type Categories</A></B>:
Autopsy can sort the files in an image file based on their file type.
For example, all JPEG and GIF files would be identified as images
and all executable files would be identified.  This mode will also
ignore files that are found in hash databases of known good files,
identify files that are found in a hash database of known bad files,
and identify files that have an extension that is not consistent
with their file type.


<LI><B>Report Generation</B>:  
Each of the above browsing techniques allows a report to be generated.
This report lists the date, md5 value, investigator, and other
context information in a text format.  This can be used for record
keeping when deleted blocks of data have been found.
