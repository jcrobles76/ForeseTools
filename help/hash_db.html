<H3>Overview</H3>
Hash databases are used to quickly identify known good and known
bad files using the MD5 or SHA-1 checksum value.  Autopsy uses
three types of hash databases to help the investigator reduce the
number of files that they have to look at.

<P>
The <B>NIST National Software Reference Library (NSRL)</B> contains
hashes of files that are found in operating systems and software
distributions.  These files are <I>known to be good</I> in that they came
from trusted sources and are typically on authorized systems.  When
processing files in the image, this database can be used to ignore
files because they are assumed to be known and therefore uninteresting.
The location of this database is configured when Autopsy is installed.
The NSRL must be obtained from NIST at <TT>www.nsrl.nist.gov</TT>.

<P>
The <B>Ignore Database</B> is a database that the investigator must
create.  It is similar to the NIST NSRL in that it contains files
that are <I>known to be good</I> and can be ignored if the user
chooses to do so (only applicable when in <A HREF="file_category.html">File
Type Category Analysis</A>).  Examples of files in this category include
system binaries for standard builds.  See <A HREF="#db_create">Database
Creation</A> for information on creating this database.  Its location
is configured when the host is created and can be edited in the
host configuration file.

<P>
The <B>Alert Database</B> is a database that the investigator must
create.  It contains hashes of <I>known bad</I> files.  These are
the files that an investigator wants to know about if they exist
on the system.  Examples of this include rootkits or unauthorized
photographs.
When using the <A HREF="file_category.html">File Type Category
Analysis</A>, these files will be saved in a special file.  See <A
HREF="#db_create">Database Creation</A> for information on creating
this database.  Its location is configured when the host is created
and can be edited in the host configuration file.


<H3>Database Uses</H3>
Autopsy uses the hash databases in three ways.  

<UL>
  <LI><B><A HREF="file_category.html">File Type Category Analysis</A></B>: The
  hash databases are used to identify the <I>known bad</I> files and
  ignore the <I>known good</I> files.  

  <LI><B><A HREF="meta_mode.html">Meta Data Analysis</A></B>: The hash
  databases can be used to identify a file from the meta data view.  If
  the databases are configured, the hash from a given file can be looked
  up by pressing the 'lookup' button.    
  All three databases can be used in this view.  This view can be found
  from the File Analysis mode by selecting the meta data address in
  the directory listing window.

  <LI><B>Hash Database Manager</B>: From the Host Gallery view, 
  the Hash Database Manager can be entered.  This is where one can
  re-index the databases and perform single lookups in any of the
  databases.  
</UL>


<A NAME="db_create">
<H3>Database Creation</H3>
Currently, Autopsy will only allows one to look entries up in a 
hash database.  It does not allow one to easily create a database,
but this will describe the process (it is quite simple).  

<P>
Autopsy uses the <TT>hfind</TT> tool from The Sleuth Kit to do the
lookups.  This tool requires the database to be indexed so that it
can perform a fast lookup using a binary search algorithm (instead
of a slower sequential search that a tool like grep would do).
When ever a hash database is updated (or created), it must be
indexed.  This can be done in Autopsy in the Hash Database Manager
(Note that the database must already be configured though).

<P>
The NIST NSRL obviously does not have to be created, but it does have
to be indexed before it is used.

<P>
To make a hash database, we will create a file with the same format
as the <TT>md5sum</TT> command uses.  This is just the MD5 hash,
some white space, and the file name.  For example:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>c4a6761b486de3c6abf7cf2c554289e5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/bin/ps</TT><P>

Make a file with this format for every line (it does not have to
be sorted).  For example, if you have a trusted system then you can make
a hash database of its system binaries using the following:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT># md5sum /bin/* /sbin/* > bin-md5.db</TT><P>

After creation, hash databases must be indexed and sorted (this
includes the NSRL).  Databases will be indexed by using the
<TT>hfind</TT> tool.  The NSRL database would be indexed with:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT># hfind -i nsrl-md5  PATH_TO_NSRL/NSRLFile.txt</TT><P>

A database made by <TT>md5sum</TT> would be indexed with:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT># hfind -i md5sum  bin-md5.db</TT><P>

Or, if Autopsy has this file configured from when the host was added,
then it can be re-indexed from the Hash Database Manager.

<H3>Autopsy Configuration</H3>
The alert and ignore databases are stored in the host configuration file
with the headers of 'exclude_db' and 'alert_db'.  For example:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>alert_db&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'/usr/local/hash/bad.db'</TT><P>
These entries can be edited at any time.  

<P>
The NSRL database is configured in the <TT>conf.pl</TT> file in the
directory where Autopsy was installed.  It has the $NSRLDB variable.  
For example:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>$NSRLDB = '/usr/local/hash/nsrl/NSRLFile.txt';</TT><P>

It can be edited, added, and removed at any time (but you must restart
Autopsy).
