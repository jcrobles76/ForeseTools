<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
In many investigations, evidence is not found in the order that it was
created during the incident.  The notes feature in Autopsy allows one to
make notes about certain files, but it does not help one to put a 
series of events in order.  

<P>
The Event Sequencer allows the investigator to make notes and comments
about pieces of evidence.   Each note must have a time associated with
it.  For files and meta data, the times can be one or more of the
MAC times.  Other notes can have times entered manually.  The sequencer
will sort the events after each is entered so that the investigator can
quickly identify where there are gaps in the findings. 

<H3>Adding an Event</H3>
<P>
To add an event for a file, directory, or meta data structure, select
the <U>Add Note</U> button.  At the bottom will be check boxes that allow
an event to be generated for each of the file's times.  The "standard"
note does not have to be generated if it is not needed.  

<P>
To add an event from a different source, go to the Event Sequencer from
the Host Gallery (where the images are listed).  At the bottom of
the window will be an area where the new event can be added.  The
<B>Source</B> of the event will be shown where the file name of
a file event is normally shown.  Examples of this type include 
entries from firewall logs or reports from the help desk. 

<H3>Viewing the Sequence Events</H3>
<P>
The <U>Event Sequencer</U> button can be found in the Host Gallery.  
This window shows the events that are sorted by the time.  Events that
correspond to a file, directory, or meta data structure will have either
[M-Time], [A-Time], or [C-Time] in the note that shows what time this 
event was generated from.  Clicking on the name will show the contents of 
the file or directory.
